# The Flying Chicken

By The King of Rhodesia  

I went in to work as a cop, you see  
My boss told the crew and me  
We landed a trip to Israel for FREE  

When we got there I saw strange sightings  
Flying chickens the were ah fighting  
The Jews had sinned—they were expiating  

I told my boss I wanted to leave  
And to an island did he send me  
The young girls, the chickens—I prayed on my knees  

They killed me there on the island  
To Heaven I was flying
