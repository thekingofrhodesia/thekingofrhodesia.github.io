# Analysis of "The Flying Chicken"

*I went in to work as a cop, you see*  
*My boss told the crew and me*  
*We landed a trip to Israel for FREE*  

Many police departments get funding from the American Israel Public Affairs Committee (AIPAC). Just like many politicians, they will get free trips to Israel and learn to treat their own citizens like the Israelis treat the Palestinians (see [here](https://alphanews.org/beyond-description-minnesotan-recounts-time-in-israel-as-part-of-bipartisan-delegation/) and [here](https://culturewars.com/videos/the-truth-about-the-revolution?rq=George%20Floyd)).

*When we got there I saw strange sightings*  
*Flying chickens the were ah fighting*  
*The Jews had sinnedâ€”they were expiating*  

The Jews have a ritual called the Kapparot in which they transfer their sins to chickens (see [here](https://youtu.be/tA6pDG4Lh4k?si=E6BzIFjyl7Bb8Pl1) and [here](https://youtu.be/tA6pDG4Lh4k?si=Aht3-WGdqtjweTK1) for more context).
