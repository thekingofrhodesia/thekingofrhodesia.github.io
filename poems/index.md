# Poems

The King of Rhodesia loves reading and writing poetry. If a poem was written by the King himself, it will mention that it is by him. If you wish to submit a poem for the king to read, please send him an email at [thekingofrhodesia@proton.me](mailto:thekingofrhodesia@proton.me)

[100 Years Ago](/poems/100-years-ago/)

wonder about

My boss told the crew and me  
We landed a trip to Israel for FREE  
...  

[The White Man's Burden](/poems/the-white-mans-burden/)

Take up the White Man's burden—  
    Send forth the best ye breed—  
Go bind your sons to exile  
  To serve your captives' need;
