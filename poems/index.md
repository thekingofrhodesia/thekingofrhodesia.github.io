[Banking is Gay](/poems/banking-is-gay/)

A coin extra on top
These endless floors I mop,
When ever will it stop.
...

[My Jewish Friend](/poems/my-jewish-friend/)

I had a friend who was a Jew
The braids and all
The chosen few
...

[Stinky Jews](/poems/stinky-jews/)

Oh how I hate those stinky Jews,
And how they make me pay my dues
...
