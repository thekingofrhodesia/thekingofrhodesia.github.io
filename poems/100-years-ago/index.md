# 100 Years Ago

Okay sometimes I sit and  
wonder about  
stuff I do not know  

like what the Earth  
was like 100 years ago  

did cavemen ride on dinosaurs  
did flowers even grow  
did spiders rule the Earth  
were deserts filled with snow  

there were no books or  
humans so  

how are we to know  

what like Was like 100 years ago.
