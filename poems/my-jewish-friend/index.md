# My Jewish Friend

By The King of Rhodesia

I had a friend who was a Jew 
The braids and all 
The chosen few 

I asked him once to lend me money 
He said that's fine 
But with extra pennys. 

With that money I bought some gold 
To fight inflation 
I had been told 

When the time had come to pay back 
50 percent interest he said 
A hack! 

I was pissed at him 
My friend no more 

I shot him... 
I'm no longer poor
