## About His Majesty

Born from the noble halls of Preston High, King Napoleon claimed the forgotten throne of Rhodesia with nothing but dance skills, nunchuck mastery, and a deep love of tater tots. 

He is the first monarch to rule via awkward charisma and VHS training videos. His royal steed is a llama named Tina.

> "Gosh! I just wanna bring glory back to the kingdom."
